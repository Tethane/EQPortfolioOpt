## What
- Provides a tool for determining the "optimal" portfolio weightings of a portfolio including securities and cash investments using Modern Portfolio Theory.
- Stocks can be inputted to a list to find the estimated risk (standard deviation of returns) and returns (determined from Fama-French model and Arbitrage Pricing Theory models)
- TODO: Integrate with main project so that backtested systems can be added to the portfolio and their weightings (capital allocations) can be optimized.
